# The Demographics of Diabetes

November 14, 2020
 
## Abstract
The Pima Indians of Arizona are a tight knit community that is genetically isolated. They also have the highest diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes than any other population group in the world (Baier, 2004). I use a dataset of medical information about the Pima Indians to determine if demographics and health statistics can identify people at higher risk of diabetes. This algorithm can help medical professionals identify at-risk individuals for early intervention and prevent possible development into type 2 diabetes.
